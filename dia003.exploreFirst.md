is this something we can turn into a plan of action, with milestones? 

our goal is .. we want to create a checklist for each of the 10 sections above 
within those - a basic breakdown of how we "measure done" 
-----

Certainly! Turning the "Organizational Analysis and Development" component into a plan of action with clear milestones and a checklist can help in effectively measuring and achieving the desired outcomes. Here's a breakdown for this section:

### Measuring 'Done'

For each of the above phases, 'done' can be measured by:

- Completion of all listed activities within each phase.
- Successful achievement of each phase's milestone.
- Positive feedback from stakeholders and participants.
- Demonstrable improvements in organizational metrics related to the assessment findings (e.g., increased employee engagement, streamlined workflow processes).

This structured approach ensures that each aspect of organizational analysis and development is addressed methodically, with clear indicators for progress and completion.
